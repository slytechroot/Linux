🍓 Useful Linux Commands for Managing Users, Directories, System Operations, and Logs

 🍓 Create a Directory Without a Name  
To create a directory without a name, use the following command:  
$ mkdir /tmp/" "

 🍓 Create a Directory with -name (Ignore - with --)  
To create a directory with -name (and ignore any potential conflicts with command options), use:  
$ mkdir -- "-name"

 🍓 Create User  
There are two commands to create a user:

- useradd: A low-level command available on all Linux distributions, but it requires additional parameters to fully set up the user account.  
  Example:  
 
  useradd username
  

- adduser: A higher-level command with more interactive prompts, but not available on all distributions. It simplifies the user creation process with default settings.  
  Example:  
 
  adduser username
  

 🍓 Create a Group  
You can create a group using either of these commands:

- groupadd: Available on all Linux systems, but it is not as interactive.  
  Example:  
 
  groupadd groupname
  

- addgroup: More interactive and shows output to confirm actions.  
  Example:  
 
  addgroup groupname
  

 🍓 Change Password  
To change a user's password, use the passwd command:  
$ passwd username

 🍓 Delete User  
You can delete a user with:

- userdel: Deletes a user and their files (use -r to also delete the user's home directory).  
  Example:  
 
  userdel -r username
  

- deluser: Deletes a user without deleting their files.  
  Example:  
 
  deluser username
  

 🍓 Switch User  
To switch users in the terminal:

- su user: Switch to the user, but keep your current home directory.  
  Example:  
 
  su username
  

- su - user: Switch to the user and load their .profile, changing the home directory to theirs.  
  Example:  
 
  su - username
  

 🍓 Top 10 Changes After Creating a User with useradd

4. /etc/gshadow: Stores the group’s password.
5. /home/username: Creates the user's home directory.
6. /etc/security: Specifies the limits for users, such as restricting access to other users' files in /home/.
7. /var/spool/mail/username: Creates a mailbox for the user.
8. /etc/skel: The skeleton directory where files shared with new users can be stored.
9. PATH: The echo $PATH command gives access to system paths to run commands.
