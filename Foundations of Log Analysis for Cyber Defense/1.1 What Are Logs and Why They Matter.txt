1.1 What Are Logs and Why They Matter
Introduction

In cybersecurity operations, especially from a Blue Team perspective, logs are fundamental to visibility, monitoring, and response. They represent the footprints of everything that happens in a system, application, or network. Without logging, detecting abnormal behavior or tracking malicious activity becomes nearly impossible.

A log is a timestamped record generated by a system, application, service, device, or security tool. Logs document events such as user authentications, process executions, network connections, file accesses, configuration changes, system errors, or security policy violations.
Types of Logs (by Source)
Source	Log Example	Use Case for Blue Team
Operating System (Linux)	/var/log/auth.log	SSH login attempts, sudo usage
Operating System (Windows)	Security.evtx	Logons, process creations, privilege usage
Network Devices	Firewall logs, DHCP logs	Blocked traffic, address leasing
Web Servers	Apache, Nginx access/error logs	Suspicious URIs, 404 fuzzing, directory traversal
Security Tools	EDR, antivirus, SIEM logs	Threat detections, lateral movement
Cloud Infrastructure	AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log	API misuse, privilege escalation attempts
Event vs Log

    Event: A single instance or action (e.g., “User X logged in”).
    Log: The written record of an event, possibly structured (JSON) or unstructured (plaintext).

    Every log contains at least a timestamp, the source/system, and the description of the event. Additional fields depend on the software/hardware generating the log.

Real Examples of Log Entries

1. Linux SSH Authentication Failure

Jun 20 18:45:32 ubuntu sshd[2541]: Failed password for root from 192.168.1.23 port 49522 ssh2

    Interpretation: The system rejected an SSH password attempt for the root user from IP 192.168.1.23.
    Use Case: Correlate multiple failed attempts to detect brute-force activity.

2. Windows Logon Event (Security.evtx, Event ID 4624)

Log Name: Security
Event ID: 4624
Logon Type: 10
Account Name: Administrator
Source Network Address: 10.0.0.14

    Interpretation: A successful Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) login from 10.0.0.14 to the Administrator account.
    Use Case: Detection of unauthorized RDP access or lateral movement.

3. Web Server Access Log (Apache)

192.168.1.50 - - [29/Jun/2025:14:23:42 +0000] "GET /admin HTTP/1.1" 401 487

    Interpretation: Client 192.168.1.50 attempted to access a restricted area (/admin) and received a 401 Unauthorized.
    Use Case: Detecting probing or web-based brute-force against login/admin portals.

4. IDS Alert (Suricata JSON format)

{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-29T16:21:00.512293Z",
  "event_type": "alert",
  "src_ip": "192.168.1.10",
  "dest_ip": "10.10.1.23",
  "alert": {
    "signature": "ET SCAN Nmap -sS Syn Scan",
    "severity": 2
  }
}

    Interpretation: Intrusion detection system identified a SYN scan likely from Nmap.
    Use Case: Alert triage, source attribution, trigger correlation in SIEM.

Why Logs Are Critical for Blue Teams

    Visibility: Logs provide insight into user activity, system changes, and potential threats.
    Forensics: In post-incident investigation, logs are often the only timeline available.
    Detection Engineering: All detection rules (e.g., in SIEM or EDR) rely on log-based patterns.
    Compliance and Auditing: Regulatory frameworks like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 require evidence of logging.
    Threat Hunting: Hypothesis-based searches through logs can reveal stealthy attackers.

Common Blue Team Use Cases Involving Logs
Use Case	Related Log Type(s)
Detect brute-force attacks	SSH logs, Event ID 4625 (Windows)
Investigate privilege abuse	Event ID 4672 (Windows), sudo logs (Linux)
Detect suspicious command execution	Event ID 4688, Sysmon, bash_history
Trace lateral movement	RDP logs, SMB connections, port scans
Identify web attack vectors	Apache/Nginx access logs, WAF logs
Monitor file access or exfil	File integrity logs, EDR telemetry
Logging Pitfalls to Avoid

    No central logging: Local logs are easily erased by attackers.
    No time sync (NTP): Event correlation becomes unreliable.
    Unstructured logging: Makes automation and parsing harder.
    Insufficient retention: Historical analysis becomes impossible.
    Too much noise: Without filtering, important signals get buried.

Logs are the foundation of security operations. Whether responding to incidents, building detections, or hunting for threats, Blue Teams depend on accurate, complete, and well-structured log data. Understanding the types of logs, their format, and their role in daily security tasks is the first step toward mastering log analysis.
